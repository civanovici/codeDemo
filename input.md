1. let's create a new component named DataTable based on react-table that looks like in the screenshot

2. I can't see the demo-table page

3. generate some mock data for dataTable (about 10 records) that should be loaded by default

4. extract the mock data to a separate file

5. now I want to add a new functionality for the component table, when we have data in the table, to show a column with checboxes that allow to select a row. the table should expose a callback method with selected rows. Also the table hader should have a checkbox that will allow to select all rows; if only a few rows are selected, than the column should have an indeterminate state
